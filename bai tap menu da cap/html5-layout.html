    <article>
        <p>SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Qualcomm sought to become the 
            sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s iPhone to recoup a $1-billion
             “incentive payment” that Apple insisted on, not to block rivals from 
             the market, Qualcomm’s chief executive testified on Friday.</p>

        <p>The payment from Qualcomm to Apple - part of a 2011 deal between Apple and Qualcomm - was meant 
            to ease the technical costs of swapping out the iPhone’s then-current
             Infineon chip with Qualcomm’s, CEO Steve Mollenkopf testified at a trial 
             with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.<br/><br/>
             While such a payment is common in the industry, the size of it was not, 
             Mollenkopf said.<br/><br/>

             Under the 2011 deal, Qualcomm was named Apple’s sole supplier of modem 
             chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks, in 
             exchange for which Qualcomm agreed to give Apple a rebate - the exact
            nature of which has not been disclosed. Apple could choose another 
            supplier but it would lose the rebate, effectively increasing the cost
            of its chips.<br/>
             <br/>
            Antitrust regulators have argued the deal with Apple was part of a
            pattern of anticompetitive conduct by Qualcomm to preserve its
            dominance in modem chips and exclude players like Intel.<br/><br/>

            At a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Mollenkopf testified 
            that Apple demanded the $1 billion without any assurance of how many 
            chips it would buy, which pushed the chip supplier to pursue an 
            exclusivity arrangement in order to ensure it sold enough chips to 
            recover the payment.<br/><br/>

            Qualcomm was not aiming to block rivals like Intel, he said.<br/><br/>

            “The risk was, what would the volume be? Would we get everything we 
            wanted, given that we paid so much in incentive?” Mollenkopf testified.<br/><br/>

            Earlier in the day, Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified
             that it was Apple’s practice to pursue at least two suppliers and as 
             many as six for each of the more than 1,000 components in the iPhone.<br/><br/>

            The company stopped trying to place an Intel modem chip in the iPad 
            Mini 2 because losing the rebates on Qualcomm’s chips would have made 
            the overall cost too high, he said.<br/><br/>

            “They made it very unattractive for us to use another chip supplier,” 
            Blevins said of the rebates. “These rebates were very, very large.”
