    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">
                Never stop getting better - that's the idea behind the Audi Q7. 
                It combines masculinity with lightness. The interior is spacious 
                and comfortable. The boot also offers even more space for your ideas 
                - as a five-seater it holds up to 890 litres of pure luggage volume 
                and is highly variable. Whether for a business trip or a family outing 
                - the Audi Q7 is always the ideal companion.

        <div style="position: relative; width: 40%; float: right; margin-top: 0;">
            <p class="noidung">The Audi Q7 stands sovereign on the road. A flexibly 
                shaped Singleframe dominates the front, the daytime running light 
                draws a striking double-arrow graphic in the headlights. The tailgate 
                with standard LED combination rear lights surrounds the steep D-pillars. 
                Inserts with quattro lettering in the door strip attachments structure 
                the lower area of the vehicle side. The attachments follow a new colour 
                and material concept.  The Audi Q7 is one of the lightest models in its 
                segment. Thanks to Audi’s strict lightweight construction the base model 
                still lies under two tonnes empty weight (without driver). The body alone 
                saves 71 kilograms thanks to the innovative multi-material construction 
                with many aluminium parts.</p>

            <p class="noidung">Despite the impressive dimensions and the generous 
                interior, the driving experience is almost that of a sporty limousine. 
                The excellent driving comfort is ensured, among other things, by the 
                precise electro mechanical steering and the weight reduction on the 
                front and rear axle. The Audi Q7 is relaxed on a fast motorway ride, 
                agile on winding country roads and thanks to optional all-wheel steering, 
                it is extremely agile during manoeuvring in confined spaces. Complemented 
                by the quattro drive, a fast shifting tiptronic and the low overall weight, 
                a stable driving style is ensured even off the beaten track.</p>

<h1>Elegant and luxurious</h1>

<p class="noidung" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%; margin-right:20%;
    margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom:100px;"> 
    The interior of the Audi Q7 conveys a feeling of vastness, generosity and 
    cultivated elegance. The clear architecture and the logical operating concept work 
    perfectly together – all switches and controllers are ideally at hand. All the 
    colours and materials of the interior are carefully coordinated. For even more 
    comfort while driving, the individual contour seats with massage function are 
    optionally available. The leather upholstery is perforated and the driver and 
    front passenger seats can be cooled and heated at the touch of a button. The 
    optional ambient lighting includes illuminated door sills and additional contour 
    lighting on the centre tunnel console and ensures a pleasant atmosphere in the dark. 
    In addition, a very low noise level supports the pleasant room feeling.<br/><br/>
    The operating concept of the Audi Q7 offers extensive high-tech technology: 
    The MMI all-in-touch control panel with a large touchpad makes operation 
    intuitively easy. The optionally available Audi virtual Cockpit, a fully digital 
    instrument cluster with high-resolution 12.3-inch display, can be adjusted to your 
    personal preferences in no time – either with classic display of speed and rpm as 
    large round instruments or with progressive, large-screen display of navigation, 
    radio and media information, for example. The optional head-up display, which 
    projects the most important displays as well as information from assistance 
    systems and navigation onto the windscreen directly into the driver's field of 
    vision, provides increased driving comfort. The thermal imaging camera of the 
    night vision assistant increases driving safety in the dark – it points out 
    persons and larger wild animals that are detected directly in the Audi virtual 
    cockpit and in the head-up display. A pleasant entertainment experience is 
    provided by the optionally available Bang & Olufsen sound system with 3D sound 
    and Audi tablets as mobile rear seat entertainment for the fund passengers.</p>
