<br/>
<p class="gioithieu" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">
        The Audi Q3 is a real all-rounder. Whether on holiday or in everyday life - 
        it offers plenty of space and provides plenty of variability thanks to many 
        practical details. With increased dimensions and an even more 
        dynamically-designed exterior, it strikes a challenging balance between 
        sportiness and everyday use. The driving experience is also sporty and 
        comfortable at the same time. Thus it masters every challenge, whether in 
        the city, on country lanes or on the motorway.</p><br/><br/>

<h1>An Allrounder</h1>

<p class="noidung" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%; margin-right:20%;
    margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;"> 
    The new Audi Q3, which is based on the Volkswagen Group’s modular transverse matrix, 
    has grown in virtually all dimensions and is positioned in the upper compact SUV 
    segment. It is 4,485 millimeters (14.7 ft) long, making it 97 millimeters (3.8 in) 
    longer than its predecessor. In terms of width, it has grown 25 millimeters (1.0 in) 
    to 1,856 millimeters (6.1 ft), but at 1,585 millimeters (5.2 ft) is 5 millimeters 
    (0.2 in) flatter than the first-generation Q3. Its wheelbase, which has been 
    stretched 77 millimeters (3.0 in) to 2,680 millimeters (8.8 ft) is much more 
    spacious – knee room, headroom and elbow room are even larger.</p>

<a href="image-gallery.html#Q3"><img src="img/Q3_2.jpg" title="Q3_2" alt="Q3_2"
    style="margin-left:7%; margin-top: 100px;"/></a>
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10%; margin-top: 10px;">
            <span>Fuel consumption combined *: 7.6-4.7 l/100km</span>
            <span>CO₂-emissions combined *: 173-123 g/km</span>
            </div>

<h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Ready for everyday life</h1>

<p class="noidung" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%; margin-right:20%;
    margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;"> 
    Maneuverable in town, agile on country roads, balanced on the highway – the 
    suspension on the Audi Q3 offers a wide spread. The sporty character of the 
    predecessor model has been retained, but enhanced with a clear dose of additional 
    comfort. The new SUV takes bumpy roads with ease – thanks also to the longer 
    wheelbase. As an option, the driver can vary the characteristics of the Audi Q3 
    depending on the driving situation, road conditions or personal needs using the 
    Audi drive select dynamic handling system. It offers six profiles – from markedly 
    comfortable, highly efficient through to out-and-out sporty.<br/><br/>
    The new Audi Q3 looks much sportier than its predecessor. The Singleframe in 
    octagon design and large side air inlets characterize the masculine front-end. 
    Eight vertical bars divide up the radiator grille with its striking frame and 
    reflect the SUV character. The headlights are narrow and run inwards with their 
    wedge shape. Audi supplies them in three versions, all with LED technology. A 
    highlight in the side view is the symmetrical lighting graphics of the headlights 
    and rear lights. The shoulder line connects them from a styling perspective and 
    provides an athletic overall impression with strong muscles over the wheel arches. 
    The contours draw their inspiration from Audi’s quattro DNA and make the SUV seem 
    even wider; the color-contrasting wheel arch trims emphasize the offroad look. 
    Supported by a long roof edge spoiler, which also flanks the rear window at the 
    side, the steeply raked D pillars of the body line also create an appearance of 
    orward thrust.</p>

Lighting technology</h2>
<p class="noidung" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 25%; margin-right:25%;
    margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;"> The headlights are narrow and run inwards 
    with their wedge shape. Audi supplies them in three versions, all with LED 
    technology. The top-of-the-line version are the Matrix LED headlights whose 
    adaptive high beam intelligently illuminates the road. A highlight in the side 
    view is the symmetrical lighting graphics of the headlights and rear lights.</p>

<a href="image-gallery.html#Q3"><img src="img/Q3_3.jpg" title="Q3_3" alt="Q3_3"
    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-left:0; margin-right:0;
    margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;"/></a>

<h2 style="margin-top: 100px; margin-left: 15%; text-align: left;">
Intelligently connected</h2>
<p class="noidung" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 25%; margin-right:25%;
    margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;"> The operating and display concept of the 
    family SUV has been overhauled from the ground up – Audi has done away with the 
    analog instruments. Even with the standard MMI radio there is a digital instrument 
    cluster with a 10.25 inch screen diagonal, which the driver operates using the 
    multifunction steering wheel. With MMI radio plus, the first option level, 
    customers can upgrade the instrument cluster as an option to the Audi virtual 
    cockpit with additional functions. It incorporates, for instance, the MMI 
    functions and, in addition to road and engine speed, also displays information 
    on music tracks and Audi connect services.</p>
