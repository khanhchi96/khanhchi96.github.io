    <a href="home.html#Q8"><h3>Audi Q8</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">The Audi Q8 combines the elegance of a four-door luxury coupé with the versatility of an SUV. The powerful front and the sloping roof line create dynamism. The sporty interior conveys a luxurious charm and, together with the optionally-adjustable rear seat, also offers plenty of space in the rear. The lounge character of the interior makes it an ideal companion for business or leisure.

<h1>The new face of the Q family</h1>

<br/>
<p> With the imposing Singleframe in octagonal design, the Audi Q8 is the new face of the Q family. The brawny radiator grille stands upright and, together with the spoiler that has been drawn toward the front and the large, highly contoured air inlets, emphasizes the self-confident look. The elegantly sloping roofline terminates in gently inclined D-pillars and rests against the quattro blisters above the wheel arches, which house up to 22-inch wheels. A light strip connects the units at the rear.</p>

<p> Sporty compact proportions paired with the deep roof and a flat window form the rear section. The boot lid of the Audi Q8 ends in a tear-off edge - it connects the rear quattro blisters. A narrow, high-gloss black element with an integrated light band stretches between the rear lights. It is a feature of Audi's top models and emphasises the width of the Q8. Both by day and by night, an independent light signature is created, as was the case with the original quattro. The striking diffuser with its four vertical guide elements captures the look of the single frame. The large tailpipe apertures are integrated at its edges.</p>

<h3>The off-road look</h3>

<br/>

<p> The spoiler, wheel arch trims, door attachment strips and diffuser are highlighted in colour to emphasise the off-road look. The design is reminiscent of the original quattro in many details. A light band connects the units at the rear with each other. As with the Audi Ur-quattro, it is underlaid with a black surface.</p>
