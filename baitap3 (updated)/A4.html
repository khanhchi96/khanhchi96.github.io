<h1>Concision from bonnet to boot</h1>
<br/>
<p> 4.73 metres long and a 2.82 metre wheelbase – the Audi A4 Saloon cuts a confident figure on the road. At the front and rear, clear horizontal lines emphasise its width. The fluid design with concise lines conveys a dynamic elegance. The combination of optional wheels of up to 19 inches. and the wide, flat Singleframe grille further underlines the sporty look. The optional headlights with LED or Audi Matrix LED technology, including dynamic indicators, create visual accents.<br/>

 

    Sporty on the one hand, comfortable on the other. The five-link axles and electro-mechanical power steering form the basis for dynamic handling and first-class driving comfort – both of these are extremely light, and also reduce fuel consumption. Dynamic steering is an available option. This varies the ratio depending on speed and steering angle – for even more confidence and a sporty driving experience.</p>
