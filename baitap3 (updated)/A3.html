    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">The sporty and expressive lines give the Audi A3 Sportback a dynamic appearance. The long wheelbase and the short front overhang underline its balanced, sporty proportions. Supplemented by a large selection of driver assistance systems, the Audi A3 models are ideal for the city and at the same time will win you over on spontaneous excursions. An additional highlight is the optionally-available Audi virtual cockpit.</p>

<h1>The Audi A3 Sportback.</h1>

<br/>
<p> The dynamic roof contour underlines the athletic character of the Audi A3 Sportback. The distinctive tornado line along the edge of the windows and the dynamic line above the sills show its lean side of the five-door. The rear view is dominated by the three-dimensional combination rear lights, the clearly separated lines and a wide diffuser. In keeping with its dynamic character, the Audi A3 Sportback with the optionally available S line selection appears to be in the fast lane and also emphasises the individuality and dynamic demands of the vehicle and the driver alike.</p>

<p> The new A1 Sportback is available in a choice of ten colors that impressively showcase the design language. The roof of the compact model can be optionally finished in a contrasting color from the A-pillar to the roof edge spoiler. The exterior mirror housings, the side front spoiler lips and the side sills are also available in a contrasting color.</p>

<h3>Well-balanced sportiness</h3>

<br/>
<p> The chassis of the Audi A3 Sportback impresses with its sportiness: with the optional sports suspension the body is 15 millimetres lower, with the S line sports suspension it is 25 millimetres lower. The electromechanical power steering works sensitively and efficiently. The electrically assisted progressive steering system is also available as an option. All engines will impress with an agile drive with simultaneous high efficiency.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Comfortable and innovative</h3>

<p> The highlight in the interior of the Audi A3 Sportback is the Audi virtual cockpit. In addition, the optional heated three-spoke steering wheel and the massage function available as an option for the driver’s seat offer additional comfort and ensure a pleasant ride. The various equipment lines give you an individual selection – in addition to the basic equipment, there is also the S line sports package for a dynamic appearance.</p>
