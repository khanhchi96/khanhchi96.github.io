<br/>
<p> The sharp shoulder line in the form of a wave lends the Audi A5 Coupé a unique expression of emotional elegance. The characteristic wave already distinguished its predecessor model as a distinctive design element. It is now even more precisely designed and captivating with its three-dimensionality, which creates an exciting interplay of light and shadow. The slim three-dimensionally-shaped combination rear lamps are equipped with LED technology as standard. The LED light signature underlines the sculptural geometry of the combination rearlight. The outer vertical end emphasises the full width of the rear.
<br/>
 

        One of the key features of the new Audi A5 Coupé is its sporty, agile driving dynamics. In its segment, both sporty driving pleasure and comfort are decisive factors in the tuning of the chassis. The new Audi A5 Coupé manages the balancing act between driving pleasure on winding roads and excellent driving comfort over long distances.    </p>

Experience more functions with the optional Audi MMI navigation plus with MMI touch. Optional Audi smartphone interface integrates the familiar world of Google and Apple with your Audi. The entire MMI operating logic is based on current smartphones, including intelligent free text search. The new, more natural voice control also processes inputs from everyday language, e.g. "I want to call Peter".
