    <a href="home.html#Q7"><h3>Audi Q7</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">Never stop getting better - that's the idea behind the Audi Q7. It combines masculinity with lightness. The interior is spacious and comfortable. The boot also offers even more space for your ideas - as a five-seater it holds up to 890 litres of pure luggage volume and is highly variable. Whether for a business trip or a family outing - the Audi Q7 is always the ideal companion.

<h1>Greatness starts, when you don't stop</h1>

<p> The Audi Q7 stands sovereign on the road. A flexibly shaped Singleframe dominates the front, the daytime running light draws a striking double-arrow graphic in the headlights. The tailgate with standard LED combination rear lights surrounds the steep D-pillars. Inserts with quattro lettering in the door strip attachments structure the lower area of the vehicle side. The attachments follow a new colour and material concept.  The Audi Q7 is one of the lightest models in its segment. Thanks to Audi’s strict lightweight construction the base model still lies under two tonnes empty weight (without driver). The body alone saves 71 kilograms thanks to the innovative multi-material construction with many aluminium parts.</p>

<p> Despite the impressive dimensions and the generous interior, the driving experience is almost that of a sporty limousine. The excellent driving comfort is ensured, among other things, by the precise electro mechanical steering and the weight reduction on the front and rear axle. The Audi Q7 is relaxed on a fast motorway ride, agile on winding country roads and thanks to optional all-wheel steering, it is extremely agile during manoeuvring in confined spaces. Complemented by the quattro drive, a fast shifting tiptronic and the low overall weight, a stable driving style is ensured even off the beaten track.</p>

<h3>Elegant and luxurious</h3>

<br/>

<p> The interior of the Audi Q7 conveys a feeling of vastness, generosity and cultivated elegance. The clear architecture and the logical operating concept work perfectly together – all switches and controllers are ideally at hand. All the colours and materials of the interior are carefully coordinated. For even more comfort while driving, the individual contour seats with massage function are optionally available. The leather upholstery is perforated and the driver and front passenger seats can be cooled and heated at the touch of a button. The optional ambient lighting includes illuminated door sills and additional contour lighting on the centre tunnel console and ensures a pleasant atmosphere in the dark. In addition, a very low noise level supports the pleasant room feeling.

        The operating concept of the Audi Q7 offers extensive high-tech technology: The MMI all-in-touch control panel with a large touchpad makes operation intuitively easy. The optionally available Audi virtual Cockpit, a fully digital instrument cluster with high-resolution 12.3-inch display, can be adjusted to your personal preferences in no time – either with classic display of speed and rpm as large round instruments or with progressive, large-screen display of navigation, radio and media information, for example. The optional head-up display, which projects the most important displays as well as information from assistance systems and navigation onto the windscreen directly into the driver's field of vision, provides increased driving comfort. The thermal imaging camera of the night vision assistant increases driving safety in the dark – it points out persons and larger wild animals that are detected directly in the Audi virtual cockpit and in the head-up display. A pleasant entertainment experience is provided by the optionally available Bang & Olufsen sound system with 3D sound and Audi tablets as mobile rear seat entertainment for the fund passengers.</p>
