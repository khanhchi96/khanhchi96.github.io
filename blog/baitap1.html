                Bowler (2015) reported that &quot;the initial dramatic drop was from $110 a barrel of Brent
                oil in June 2014 to $80 a barrel before the OPEC meeting in late November&quot;. Thereafter, the
                Brent oil price fell significantly to below &pound;50 a barrel by early January 2015, before
                experiencing a slight recovery to about &pound;65 a barrel in May 2015. In contrast, medium-term Brent futures did not receive a material drop below the established $90–$100 a barrel
                range. At least, not until after the OPEC meeting, when they immediately adjusted to about
                &pound;70–&pound;75 a barrel and continued to kept this new range since the first half of December,
                even when the substantial rally in spot prices was taken place since the start of the year.<br/>
                <strong>Higher supply projections</strong> stemmed from positive non-OPEC developments
                (especially US shale oil) and the <strong>beyond-expectation OPEC output</strong> in <b>Iraq</b>, <b>Libya</b>, and
                <b>Saudi Arabia</b> while the <strong>below-expectation demand</strong> stemmed mostly from <b>Europe</b> and <b>Asia</b>.<br/>
                Following the decision made by OPEC in late November which was <em>not to cut down</em>
                oil production, prices fell quickly by about 20% as markets fundamentally changed
                expectations about future OPEC supply. <mark>Medium-term oil futures also adjusted sharply.</mark>
                (Kottasova, 2014).

                <h4>
                OPEC's nations
                </h4>
                <p>
                In OPEC’s November 27<sup>th</sup> meeting, there was a heated debate among OPEC
                members about &quot;the best way to respond to the falling oil prices&quot; but in the end, OPEC could
                not quite come to an agreement and ended up keeping the same amount of production. On
                behalf of the members, OPEC Secretary-General <ins>Abdalla El-Badri</ins> confirmed that they
                would produce <strong>30 million</strong> barrels a day in the following 6 months, while continuously
                watching how the market behaves. (Plumer, 2015) <br/> 
                That undoubtedly caused the oil price to crash even further. The price of Brent
                crude went from &pound;80 per barrel to &pound;70 per barrel in just a few days. And it kept tumbling to
                down below &pound;60 per barrel by mid-December and &pound;50 by January. Plumer (2015) stated
                that for all intents and purposes, OPEC was in a &quot;<em>price war</em>&quot; with the US. What that meant
                was that while it was relatively cheap to pump oil out of places like <b>Saudi Arabia</b> and
                <b>Kuwait</b>, it was however, more expensive to extract oil from Texas and North Dakota or
                other shale formations.
