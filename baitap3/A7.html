    <a href="home.html" target="_self"><h3>Audi A7</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">Identifiable, unmistakable, the Audi A7. From its sharpened lights with their own light signature, its upright front with a wide single frame and coupé-like silhouette, to its sculptural rear end – the Audi A7 Sportback is an ambassador for a revolutionary design language and at the same time carries classic quattro genes. Proof that you can stay true to your line by reinventing it.

<br/>
<p> The new A7 Sportback celebrates sporty elegance and, as an ambassador of a new style, is a car belonging to the automobile avant-garde. Sharp lines and its coupé silhouette are expressions of powerful emotionality. The lights with their own A7 signature highlight its progressive exterior. From the A-pillar placed far back, the roof spans as a flowing dome over the athletic vehicle body merging into a charismatic sculptural rear end with a continuous LED strip light. A unique appearance that is impressive even when stationary.</p>
