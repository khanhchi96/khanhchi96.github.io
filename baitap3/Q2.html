    <a href="home.html" target="_self"><h3>Audi Q2</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">The Audi Q2 takes the stage – an urban type with corners and edges. Whether for adventures off the beaten track or everyday life in the big city – the Audi Q2 is an all-rounder. Its progressive design and modern connectivity features make it ready for a new kind of mobility. The interior offers expressive colours for seat covers and decorative trims, leaving plenty of room for individual design.

<h1>A real character</h1>
<br/>
<h3>Unmistakeable</h3>

<br/>
<p> 4.19 meters long. 1205 kg weight. 2.60 meter wheelbase. A superior Cd value of 0.30. Those are the base figures. Even more spectacular is what you see: an SUV which at first glance already shows its muscles. With broad shoulders and angular styling, it is brimming with energy and confidence. Experience the Audi Q2.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Sporty Efficiency</h3>
<a href="home.html" target="_self"><img src="img/Q2_3.jpg"/></a>
<br/>
<p> Driving dynamics and efficiency are not mutually exclusive for the Audi Q2. The new SUV comes with six engines – three petrol and three diesel. Depending on the engine there is a six gear manual gearbox or an S tronic dual-clutch with seven gears. And four of the units are available with permanent four wheel drive.</p>

<h3>An urban guy</h3>
<br/>
<p> At the front sits the high-positioned, single-frame grille with an octagon-design symbol. Especially striking: the gently-sloping coupé-like roof flows into a C-pillar with a colour-contrasting blade. The Audi Q2 stands self-confidently on the road – the low roof and the high window line are reminiscent of a coupé and make the lifestyle sports car look impressive.</p>
