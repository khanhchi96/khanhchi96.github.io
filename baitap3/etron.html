    <a href="home.html" target="_self"><h3>Audi e-tron</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">Audi presents the first fully electric production vehicle - the Audi e-tron. This turns Audi's well-known e-tron technology into a series. Personal space, a powerful driving experience and self-determined mobility: no contradiction with the all-electric SUV from Audi. No matter whether you are travelling in the city or heading off to go sailing with friends - the Audi e-tron is suitable for everyday use and a faithful companion.

    <pre> Fuel consumption combined: 26.2-22.5 kWh/100km   CO₂-emissions combined: 0 g/km</pre>

<h3>Powerful dynamic with electric drive</h3>
<br/>

<br/>
<p> Two electric motors drive the Audi e-tron powerfully. They quickly accelerate the electric SUV from zero to 100 km/h. The start-off performance is comparable to that of a sports car. The new electric all-wheel drive system provide for optimal traction and handling in all driving situations. Thus, the Audi e-tron is not only pracitcal for everyday use, but also very manoeuvrable and agile when driving off-road. The quattro drive can be switched on as required – the results are a situation-specific torque distribution, flexible control of the axle moments and fun to drive on any terrain.</p>

<h3>Intelligent solutions for home and on the move: the charging concepts</h3>
<br/>

<br/>
<p> Audi offers various solutions for charging at home. The standard mobile charging system can be used with either a 230 volt household outlet or a 400 volt three-phase outlet. The optional “connect” charging system doubles the charging power to as much as 22 kW. Combined with a home energy management system, it offers intelligent functions such as charging when electricity is less expensive or with solar electricity if the home is equipped with a photovoltaic system. You can control all charging processes as well as pre-heating/pre-cooling via your smartphone with the myAudi app.

 <br/>

        There is generally no need to stop at charging stations during everyday driving. On long trips, such as when going on vacation, customers can use fast charging stations to charge with direct current (DC) at up to 150 kW – a first for series-production automobiles. This means that the Audi e-tron is all set for the next long-distance stretch of a journey in approximately half an hour. The electric SUV can also be recharged with alternating current (AC) at up to 11 kW; recharging with 22 kW is available as an option.</p>

<h3>Performance, intelligence and lightness</h3>

<p> Design and technology are fused into one: A generous arc, the wraparound, envelops the cascading instrument panel with pronounced horizontal lines as far round as the sculptural door trims. It harmoniously integrates the hood above the Audi virtual cockpit, whose sleek display stands visually free in space, as well as the displays of the optional virtual exterior mirrors. The navigation system makes intelligent destination suggestions based on previous routes – so every appointment becomes a success.</p>
