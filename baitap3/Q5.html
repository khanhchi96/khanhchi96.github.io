    <a href="home.html" target="_self"><h3>Audi Q5</h3></a>
    <br/>
    <p class="gioithieu">Impressive from the first moment - this is the Audi Q5. The exterior is characterised by the characteristic Q design, while the generously-proportioned interior offers plenty of space. Equipped with the quattro all-wheel drive with ultra technology, the Audi Q5 is efficient and dynamic - with the usual traction. Expressive, powerful and versatile: the Audi Q5 is ready for the moment.

<br/>
<p> Ready for virtually any surface. And the challenges ahead. The all-wheel drive quattro with ultra technology. For all four-cylinder engines with permanent all-wheel drive, quattro ensures that your Q5 remains efficient, dynamic, and safe without compromising traction. If quattro is not required, all-wheel drive is disabled, helping the driver save on fuel. Of course, it is always available. As soon as the situation requires quattro, the engine is ready.

 <br/>

        The Audi Q5: sporty and streamlined. A preformed single-frame grille with a solid frame dominates the aerodynamically flat front. A distinctively curved and strongly undercut shoulder line divides the side view. The strongly defined wheel arches mark out the all-wheel drive quattro, and the flat roof structure extends downwards. The horizontal lines on the rear also give the impression of width and presence. The rear lights are optionally available with dynamic turn signals. The tailgate encompasses the C-pillar – a typical feature of the Q models from Audi. A diffuser insert integrates the pipes into the exhaust system.</p>

<h3>Lets you take centre stage</h3>
<br/>
<p> The optional multi-coloured ambience lighting package ensures a pleasant atmosphere. In the top version, narrow LED light guide strips above the decorative strips in the door and instrument panel generate an impressive incident light. The door panels are also illuminated. Below the centre console, the surface lighting creates a floating effect. In the MMI, the lighting zones can be regulated and their colour individually created within a selection of 30 different colour tones.   
<br/>
        An elegant ambience which wins you over. And proves that the driver always comes first. The sensor-controlled boot release button simplifies loading. If your hands are full, you can open the boot by moving your foot. In combination with the manual lowering via the optional air suspension, you can easily stow even heavy suitcases.</p>

<p> The interior of the new Audi Q5 is oriented towards the driver. Thanks to the increased wheelbase, there is plenty of room for individuality. From high-quality materials such as Nappa leather to expressive colours to lighting, you are free to choose from many details. An elegant ambiance featuring acoustic glazing as well as optional front sport seats with massage function are sure to impress. This proves that the driver always comes first.

        <h3>The Audi SQ5 TFSI</h3>

        <p> Even before it moves, there are lots of details that underline the dynamic appeal of the SQ5. The starker contours on the S-model air intakes and the diffuser with its honeycomb mesh complement the sporty and distinctive bumper on the front and rear. The Audi SQ5 makes an impression, not just with its powerful engine and athletic contours, but also with its versatility for everyday use. If desired, the three-part rear seat bench can be adjusted in length and inclination. Depending on the position of the rear bench, the luggage compartment has a capacity of 550 to 610 litres. With completely folded rear seat backrest, a maximum of 1,550 litres are available. 
<br/>
                Breathtaking performance, everyday practicality and progressive technology and equipment. The newly developed 3.0-litre V6 TFSI engine delivers 260 kW (354 HP) and catapults the Audi SQ5 TFSI from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.4 seconds with a striking engine sound. Clear contours, S-specific air intakes in titanium black matt and sporty door trim strips accentuate the Q design with S characteristics.</p>
